# Linked List

_A Linked List is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes._

- Each node consists of a data value and a pointer that points to the next node.
- The list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure.
- Random access of elements is not feasible and accessing an element has linear time complexity.
- The Linked List data strucure supports two three operations:
  -- Insertion => to add an element at the beginning, end or at a given index in the list.
  -- Deletion  => to remove an item given its index or value.
  -- Search    => to find an element given its value.

## Linked List Usage

- All applications of both stacks and queues are applications of linked lists.
