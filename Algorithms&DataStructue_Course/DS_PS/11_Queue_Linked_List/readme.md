# Queue Linked List

_The queue linked list data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of first in first out (FIFO)._

- The first element inserted into the queue is the first element to be removed.
- A queue people. People enter the queue at one end (rear/tail) and leave the queue from the other end (front/head).
- Queue is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model.
- The Queue data strucure supports two main operations:
  -- Enqueue => Which adds an element to the rear/tail of the collection.
  -- Dequeue => Which removes an element from front/head of the collection.

## Queue Usage

- Printers.
- CPU task scheduling.
- Callback queue in JavaScript.

### Queue Implementation 

- Enqueue => add an element to the queue.
- Dequeue => remove the oldest element from the queue.
- Peek    => get the value of the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
- isEmpty => check if the queue is empty.
- Size    => get the number of elements in the queue.
- Print   => visualize the elements in the queue.
