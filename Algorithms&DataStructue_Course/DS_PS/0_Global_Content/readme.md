# Data Structures

<h1>What is a Data Structure?</h1>

- A data structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently.
- A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions
  or operations that can applied to that data.

## Why learn data strucures?

- Almost every application we build involves data that is modelled in a certain way.
- To efficiently manage that data, you need data structures.
- Imagine walking into a library only to find out there is no efficient organization of
  the books and they are stored randomly.

## Why learn data structures? contd.

- The difference between a function taking a few milliseconds vs a few seconds
  or even minutes comes down to the selectionof the right data strucure.
- Data strucures help you solve problems in a more efficient way,
  both in terms of time and memory.
- Learning about data strucures also help you gain a more profound understanding
  of things you are already aware of.
