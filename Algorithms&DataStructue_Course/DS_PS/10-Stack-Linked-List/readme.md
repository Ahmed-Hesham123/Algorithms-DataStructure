# Stack Linked List

_The stack data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of last in first out (LIFO)._

- The first element inserted into the stack is the last element to be removed.
- A stack of plates. The last plate placed on top of the stack is also the first plate removed from the stack.
- Stack is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model.
- The stack data strucure supports two main operations:
  -- Push => Which adds an element to the collection.
  -- Pop  => Which removes the most recently added element from the collection.

## Stack Usage

- Browser history tracking.
- Undo operation when typing.
- Expression conversions.
- Call stack in JavaScript runtime.

### Stack Implementation 

- Push    => add an element to the top of the stack.
- Pop     => remove the top most element from the stack.
- Peek    => get the value of the top element without removing it.
- isEmpty => check if the stack is empty.
- Size    => get the number of elements in the stack.
- Print   => visualize the elements in the stack.
