# Factorial Of A Number Algorithm

## Problem:

- Give a number `n`, find the Factorial of that integer.
- In Mathematics, the Factorial of a non-negative integer `n`, denoted n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.
- _Factorial of Zero is 1_.

### Examples

- factorial(4) = 24 (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
- factorial(5) = 120 (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
