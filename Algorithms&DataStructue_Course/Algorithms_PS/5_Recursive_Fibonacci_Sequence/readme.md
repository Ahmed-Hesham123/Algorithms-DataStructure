# Recursive Fibonacci Sequence Algorithm

## Problem:

- Give a number `n`, find the last `n`, element of the Fibonacci Sequence.
- In Mathematics, the Fibonacci Sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
- _The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1 (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5....)_.

### Examples

- fibonacci(0) = 0
- fibonacci(1) = 1
- fibonacci(6) = 8
