# Prime Number Algorithm

## Problem:

- Give a natural number `n`, determine if the number is Prime or not.
- A Prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.

### Examples

- isPrime(5) = true (1 * 5 or 5 * 1)
- isPrime(4) = false (1 * 4 or 2 * 2 or 4 * 1)
