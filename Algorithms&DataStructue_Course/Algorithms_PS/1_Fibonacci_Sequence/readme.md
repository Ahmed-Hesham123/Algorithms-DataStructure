# Fibonacci Sequence Algorithm

## Problem:

- Give a number `n`, find the first `n`, elements of the Fibonacci Sequence.
- In Mathematics, the Fibonacci Sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
- _The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1_.

### Examples

- fibonacci(2) = [0, 1]
- fibonacci(3) = [0, 1, 1]
- fibonacci(7) = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
