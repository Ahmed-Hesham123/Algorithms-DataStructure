# Algorithms

<h1>What is an Algorithm?</h1>

- An Algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

## Recipe Analogy:

<h3>Ingredients ===> Recipe ===> Tasty dish</h3>

      = = = = = = = =
    - Cup of Noodles. - ===>\\      1. Boil water.
    - Taste Marker.   - ===>==>>    2. Pour water into cup.
    - Water.          - ===>//      3. Add taste maker.
      = = = = = = = =               4. Close lid and wait 4 minutes.

## Programming: ðŸ‘‹

**An Algorithm to add two numbers.**

<h3>Input ===> Algorithm ===> Output</h3>

      = = = = = = = =
    - Two Numbers.   -  ===>\\      1. Add numbers using `+` => sum of a and b.
                              ===>>
    - `a` and `b`.   -  ===>//      2. Return the value.
      = = = = = = = =

## Characteristics:

- An algorithm should have well defined inputs and outputs.
- Each step should be clear and unambiguous.
- Language independent.

## Whay Algorithms?

1. As a developer you are going to come across problems that you need to solve.
2. Learning algorithms translates to learning different techniques to efficiently solve those problems.
3. One Problem can be solved in many ways using different algorithms.
4. Every algorithm comes with its own tradeoffs when it comes to performance.

## Algorithm Analysis:

1. There are multiple ways to solve one problem.
   -- EX: There are multiple algorithms to sort a list of numbers.
2. How do we analyse which one of them in the most efficient algorithm?
   -- Generally, when we talk about performance, we use an absolute measure.
   --- If I run 100 meters in 12 seconds, I'm faster than someone who takes 15 secondes.
