# Longest Common Prefix

## Problem:

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string `""`.

## Examples

### Example 1:

    Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
    Output: "fl"

### Example 2:

    Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
    Output: ""
    Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

$$Big-O = O(n^2) - Logarithmic$$
