# Number of Common Factors

## Problem:

Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`,
write a function to search target in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index.
Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

## Examples

### Example 1:

    Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
    Output: -1
    Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1

### Example 2:

    Input: a = 25, b = 30
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The common factors of 25 and 30 are 1, 5.
