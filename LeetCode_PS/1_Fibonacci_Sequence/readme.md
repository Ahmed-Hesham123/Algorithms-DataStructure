# Fibonacci Sequence Algorithm

## Problem:

The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

- F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1.
- F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.

### Examples

- fibonacci(2) = 1
  -- Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
- fibonacci(3) = 2
  -- Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.
- fibonacci(4) = 3
  -- Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
